# Goal of this converter
This card convert RGB TTL (xRGB / TTLLS from some Apple IIe cards) to "standard" RGB. Color are not exactly the same as the Apple IIe color palette but is usable.  
It was designed for my Taxan Model 410-80 card to chaine it with a PCT Colorswitch (see https://github.com/patdie421/pct-connectors-rebuild/blob/main/README.md).  
It should work for other kind of card who can be connected to Taxan RGBvision (mode II) or equivalent.  
The converter is base on the output stage circuit of the Chat Mauve EVE Card (https://mirrors.apple2.org.za/ftp.apple.asimov.net/documentation/hardware/video/Le%20Chat%20Mauve%20-%20Manuel%20de%20re_25cc_2581fe_25cc_2581rence.pdf).
